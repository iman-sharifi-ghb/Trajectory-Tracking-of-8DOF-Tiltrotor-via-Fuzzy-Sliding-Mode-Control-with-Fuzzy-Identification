# Trajectory-Tracking-of-8DOF-Tiltrotor-via-Fuzzy-Sliding-Mode-Control-with-Fuzzy-Identification

In this project, we aim to develop a Fuzzy Sliding Mode Controller to control an 8-DoF, 4-motor Robot with 8 Degrees of Freedom. We assume that we don't have a dynamic model of the system at hand, resulting in the identification of the system using Fuzzy systems. As the system is underactuated, we need PD controllers to track an arbitrary trajectory decently. We evaluated our method in different scenarios and have shown that our method can get rid of the ominous chattering problem in the system as compared to only the Sliding Mode Control method.
